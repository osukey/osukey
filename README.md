# osukey(temporary)

A Misskey client based on osu!lazer.

## Developing osukey(temporary)

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
- When developing with mobile, [Xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/) is required, which is shipped together with Visual Studio or [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/).
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting, such as the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- When running on Linux, please have a system-wide FFmpeg installation available to support video decoding.

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sim1222/osukey
cd osukey
```

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside the `osukey` directory:

```shell
git pull
```

### Building

Build configurations for the recommended IDEs (listed above) are included. You should use the provided Build/Run functionality of your IDE to get things going. When testing or building new components, it's highly encouraged you use the `VisualTests` project/configuration. More information on this is provided [below](#contributing).

- Visual Studio / Rider users should load the project via one of the platform-specific `.slnf` files, rather than the main `.sln`. This will allow access to template run configurations.

You can also build and run *osu!* from the command-line with a single command:

```shell
dotnet run --project osu.Desktop
```

If you are not interested in debugging *osu!*, you can add `-c Release` to gain performance. In this case, you must replace `Debug` with `Release` in any commands mentioned in this document.

If the build fails, try to restore NuGet packages with `dotnet restore`.

_Due to a historical feature gap between .NET Core and Xamarin, running `dotnet` CLI from the root directory will not work for most commands. This can be resolved by specifying a target `.csproj` or the helper project at `build/Desktop.proj`. Configurations have been provided to work around this issue for all supported IDEs mentioned above._

### Testing with resource/framework modifications

Sometimes it may be necessary to cross-test changes in [osu-resources](https://github.com/ppy/osu-resources) or [osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). This can be achieved by running some commands as documented on the [osu-resources](https://github.com/ppy/osu-resources/wiki/Testing-local-resources-checkout-with-other-projects) and [osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/wiki/Testing-local-framework-checkout-with-other-projects) wiki pages.

### Code analysis

Before committing your code, please run a code formatter. This can be achieved by running `dotnet format` in the command line, or using the `Format code` command in your IDE.

We have adopted some cross-platform, compiler integrated analyzers. They can provide warnings when you are editing, building inside IDE or from command line, as-if they are provided by the compiler itself.

JetBrains ReSharper InspectCode is also used for wider rule sets. You can run it from PowerShell with `.\InspectCode.ps1`. Alternatively, you can install ReSharper or use Rider to get inline support in your IDE of choice.

## Contributing

When it comes to contributing to the project, the two main things you can do to help out are reporting issues and submitting pull requests. Based on past experiences, we have prepared a [list of contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) that should hopefully ease you into our collaboration process and answer the most frequently-asked questions.

Note that while we already have certain standards in place, nothing is set in stone. If you have an issue with the way code is structured, with any libraries we are using, or with any processes involved with contributing, *please* bring it up. We welcome all feedback so we can make contributing to this project as painless as possible.
